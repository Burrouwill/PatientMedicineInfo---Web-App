Patient Medicine Info Web Application

This repository contains a web application built with Spring Boot that interfaces with a PostgreSQL database using a REST API.


Problem: 

Most people have no idea about the medicines they take, quite often too afraid to ask Pharmacists / sometimes poor explanations of medicines from healthcare professionals. Patients often given a physical handout of medicines information that is un-engaging and is often lost/discarded. If you attempt to google side effects / problems associated with medicines you will be met with a plethora of information, a small proportion of which may be accurate and / or useful.

Solution:

A web app that allows patients to look up the side effects associated with a particular medicine. It provides accurate & concise information in a patient-friendly format.


Initial Goal:

To create a web application that allows users to look up side effects associated with commonly prescribed medicines. This information will be taken from the New Zealand Formulary (The current gold standard for medicines information in New Zealand) and be distilled into patient-friendly terms by myself.

The database will initially hold information for the most commonly prescribed medicines in New Zealand based on BPAC prescribing data (https://bpac.org.nz/report/2019/annual.aspx). 


Future Additions: 

Individual account support
Interaction checker

Database:

This will be the initial basic relational database. 

It will be implemented using PostgreSQL.

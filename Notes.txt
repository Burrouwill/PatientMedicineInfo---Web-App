    advice:
        "Everyone responds differently to medicines, which means that different people will experience different side effects."

        "Whenever you are taking a medicine for the first time, make sure you keep an eye out for any major side effects."

        "Many medicines have expected side effects,  for example: feeling sleepy or having an upset stomach. These can often be minimised by following certian advice. 

        However, if you experience pain, trouble breathing, an allergic reaction, vommiting or any other major discomfort contact your Doctor or Pharmacist immediately."
